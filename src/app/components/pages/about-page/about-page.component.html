    <h3>
      I am a passionate Front-End Software Developer with over 3 years of
      experience building modern, responsive websites and web based
      applications.

    <p>
      My journey to becoming a Software Developer began in 2017 when I moved to
      the United States to study Computer Science at Emporia State University
      (ESU). Here, I completed my undergraduate study and also spent 2 years
      working as a Student Web Developer for ESU's IT Department.

      After graduating in 2021, I returned to my home country of New Zealand to
      begin my first full time position at the University of Canterbury (UC) as
      a Software Developer. Here, I am a member of the team responsible for the
      development of UC's web-based Student Management System. I have primiarly
      focussed on development of the frontend via Angular, although I also have
      experience developing our backend leveraging Django, OutSystems and
      NodeJS.
