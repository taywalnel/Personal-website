        <p>
          I see myself as a very enthusiastic person and have a love for
          learning new things and collaborating with like-minded individuals on
          challenging projects. Whether I am working on a project by myself or
          as part of a team, I always strive to bring my best to the table.

          When I'm not coding, you can usually find me on the tennis court,
          hiking, or trying out a new Mexican restaurant. ðŸŒ¯
