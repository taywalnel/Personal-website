      professional experience building modern, responsive websites and web based
      applications.

      My journey began in 2017 when I moved to the United States to study
      Computer Science at Emporia State University (ESU). Here, I completed my
      undergraduate study and also spent 2 years working as a Student Web
      Developer for ESU's IT Department. During this time I was fortunate to
      play a part in ESU's development and deployment of various new websites
      including a full scale redesign of the main university website.

      After graduating in 2021, I returned to my home country of New Zealand to
      begin my first full-time position at the University of Canterbury (UC) as
      a Software Developer. Here, I am a member of the team responsible for the
      development of UC's web-based Student Management System. I have primarily
      focussed on development of the frontend of our three web based
      applications via Angular, although I also contribute to the backend
      leveraging Django and NodeJS.
