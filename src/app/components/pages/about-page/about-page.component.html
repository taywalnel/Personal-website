    <h3>
      Hello! My name is Taylor, and I am a passionate full-stack software
      developer. I have over 3 years of professional experience building modern,
      responsive websites and web-based applications.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I see myself as a very enthusiastic person and have a love for learning
      new things and collaborating with like-minded individuals on challenging
      projects. Whether I am working on a project by myself or as part of a
      team, I always strive to bring my best to the table.

    <h3 class="outro-text">
      When I'm not coding, you can usually find me on the tennis court, hiking,
      or trying out a new Mexican restaurant. 🌯
