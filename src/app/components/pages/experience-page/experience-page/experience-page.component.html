        <h3>
          My journey began in 2017 when I moved to the United States to study
          Computer Science at Emporia State University (ESU).
        </h3>
        <p>
          Here, I completed my undergraduate study and spent my final 2 years
          working as a Student Web Developer for ESU's IT Department. During
          this time, I was fortunate to play a part in some key projects
          including the redevelopment of the main university website and its
          subsidiaries as well as supporting ESUâ€™s rapid shift to an increased
          reliance on online tools brought on by COVID-19.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          After graduating in 2021, I returned to New Zealand and accepted a
          Software Development position at the University of Canterbury (UC).
        </h3>
        <p>
          Here, I have contributed to the development of UC's Student Management
          System consisting of three web-based applications leveraging Angular,
          Django and NodeJS. After several career milestones including acting as
          the lead UI developer for a period following the departure some key
          personal, I was promoted to the position of Associate Developer
          towards the end of 2022.
